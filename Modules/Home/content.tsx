Firebase Hosting provides fast and secure hosting for your web app, static and dynamic content, and microservices.


Firebase Hosting is production-grade web content hosting for developers. With a single command, you can quickly deploy web apps and serve both static and dynamic content to a global CDN (content delivery network). You can also pair Firebase Hosting with Cloud Functions or Cloud Run to build and host microservices on Firebase.

Key capabilities

Serve content over a secure connection	The modern web is secure. Zero-configuration SSL is built into Firebase Hosting, so content is always delivered securely.
Host static and dynamic content plus microservices	Firebase Hosting supports all kinds of content for hosting, from your CSS and HTML files to your Express.js microservices or APIs.
Deliver content fast	Each file that you upload is cached on SSDs at CDN edges around the world and served as gzip or Brotli. We auto-select the best compression method for your content. No matter where your users are, the content is delivered fast.
Emulate and even share your changes before going live	
View and test your changes on a locally hosted URL and interact with an emulated backend.

Share your changes with teammates using temporary preview URLs. Hosting also provides a GitHub integration for easy iterations of your previewed content.

Deploy new versions with one command	
Using the Firebase CLI, you can get your app up and running in seconds. Command line tools make it easy to add deployment targets into your build process.

And if you need to undo the deploy, Hosting provides one-click rollbacks.
